ItemMagnetPlus adds a single item called "Item Magnet" that does the obvious thing: Sucking in items around you so you don't have to run around and collect them yourself.

Adds:
Item Magnet (and corresponding buff) that
* can be crafted with simple materials
* works while in your inventory (doesn't waste an accessory slot)
* can be toggled on an off
* has adjustable range and item succ speed
* has increased stats after killing bosses
* customizable via config (\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Configs) to fit your playstyle
